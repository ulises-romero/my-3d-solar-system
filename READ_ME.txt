This is a 3D web application that relatively represents the solar system to scale. Uses a graphics pipeline to accomplish this along with discrete math to create these visuals. 

I would recommend running this app use Visual Studio Code. Install the "Live Server" plugin, afterwards, to run the web application simply click the "Go Live" button on the lower right corner of Visual Studio Code.
